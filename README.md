# Controlling-a-Self-Driving-Car
Created as a project for MAE506: Advanced Dynamics and Control at ASU. I explored and implemented full state feedback and LQR controllers
A non-linear version of the above controllers was applied by calculating the gains at each point using linearization at that instant.
The above controller was speeded up by calculating errors in the body frame of reference, and using static gain computations
